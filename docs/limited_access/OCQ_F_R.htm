        <div class="block"><p>The Occupation questionnaire section (OCQ) of the NHANES sample person household interview contains data on employment and variables relating to the work environment. OCQ_F is the main public release dataset for the NHANES 2009-10 Occupation data, however in the NHANES household interview, detailed descriptions of the work history are obtained. This data has been coded using the 2002 version of the U.S. Bureau of the Census Industrial &amp; Occupational Classification Codes. This detailed coded data is considered confidential because it represents potentially personally identifiable information, hence these codes are not publicly released by NHANES. Rather, the industry and occupation code dataset OCQ_F_R is available to researchers through the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). <br />
<br />
The following NHANES 2009-10 occupation and industry variables are collected and available through the NCHS RDC: <br />
<br />
&bull; Data for Sample Person&rsquo;s Current Job: <br />
&bull; Industry classification code (OCD231R) <br />
&bull; Occupational code (OCD241R) <br />
<br />
&bull; Data for Sample Person&rsquo;s Longest Held Job: <br />
&bull; Industry classification code (OCD391R) <br />
&bull; Occupational code (OCD392R) </p></div>

        <div class="block"><p>In NHANES 2009-2010 survey, the OCQ Questionnaire was administered to a full sample of survey participants 16+ years of age. </p></div>
        <h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2>
        <div class="block"><p>These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. Participants 16 years of age were interviewed directly. </p></div>
        <h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2>
        <div class="block"><p>The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in defining key terms used in the questionnaire. During the 2009-2010 data collection cycle, periodic QC checks were performed on the Occupation questionnaire data being collected and interviewer specific feedback and retraining was performed as appropriate.</p></div>
        <h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2>
        <div class="block"><p>A subject&rsquo;s questionnaire interview responses were entered into a pentop computer and then uploaded into a computerized database in the same manner as other sections of the Sample Person Questionnaire. The data was then edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical values. </p></div>
        <h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2>
        <div class="block"><p>Analyses requiring detailed occupation and industry codes are restricted to NHCS RDC use. Proposals for such analyses must be submitted to the NHCS RDC for review and approval and the analysis must be conducted through the RDC. </p>
<p>Four digit codes were applied to the NHANES 2009-2010 occupation and industry data using the 2002 U.S. Bureau of the Census Industrial &amp; Occupational Classification coding system. The coding was done by CDC&rsquo;s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The 2002 Census Bureau industry codes are based on the year 2002 North American Industry Classification System, and the 2002 Census Bureau occupation codes are based on the year 2000 Standard Occupational Classification System. Coding manuals and detailed data dictionaries of the alphabetical and classified indices of industries and occupations are available (NIOSH, 2017). </p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s year 2002 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was also used for detailed coding of the NHANES 2007-08 occupation and industry group code data, however the 2001-06 NHANES coding was based on the earlier year 2000 version of the U.S. Census Bureau Industry and Occupation data coding system. The 2000 and 2002 versions of the Census Bureau Industry and Occupation codes are comparable in many but not in all respects, and data analysts who wish to combine the NHANES 2005-06 industry or occupation group code data with the NHANES 2007-10 occupation group code data should consult the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s literature on the comparability of the these 2 versions of the Census Bureau&rsquo;s coding system before performing their analyses. Appendix 1 provides analysts with SAS formats for the set of Census 2002 industry and occupation codes.</p>
<p>
With respect to the 4-digit Census 2002 industry and occupation codes, analysts should be aware that in the NHANES OCQ_F_R data file, the Census 2002 industry and occupation codes are formatted as numeric variables. This means that industry and occupation codes below 1000 are represented by 3 rather than 4 digits. This is because the NHANES numeric variable format does not support values that are leading zeros. For example, the official Census 2002 code for agricultural crop production is 0170, however in the OCQ_F_R data file this code value is 170. <br />
<br />
The OCQ data were collected as part of the household questionnaire and therefore the full sample NHANES interview weights WTINT2YR should be used for statistical analysis. However, if the OCQ data are merged with the NHANES MEC exam or laboratory data, then NHANES examination sample weights WTMEC2YR should be used for analyses. Please refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/AnalyticGuidelines.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES Analytic Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and the on-line <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/" target="_blank">NHANES Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. </p></div>
