        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES
program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020
cycle was not completed.&nbsp; Data collected
in 2019-March 2020 can be accessed as convenience samples through the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/">NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)</a>. Any analyses based
solely on the 2019-March 2020 data would not be generalizable to the U.S.
civilian non-institutionalized population. Please refer to the Analytic Notes
section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Iodine is an essential element for thyroid function, necessary for
normal growth, development and functioning of the brain and body. Without
adequate intake of iodine, the thyroid gland cannot produce sufficient thyroid
hormones and a spectrum of adverse effects can occur.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Also,
insufficient intake can lead to disordered thyroid function in pregnant women,
low stores in the newborn infant, and altered thyroid function in other
susceptible individuals. Prior NHANES cycles have shown the iodine status of
the general U.S. population has decreased by approximately half since NHANES
III, but levels are still considered adequate, and about 7% of pregnant women
in the U.S. have insufficient iodine intake (Hollowell et al. 1998). The health
effects of mild iodine deficiency are not known.</p>
<p>
The main sources of iodine in the U.S. include dairy products, eggs,
baked goods, iodized table salt, and some dietary supplements.&nbsp; Although
some salts have iodine added, these iodine levels tend to degrade over time,
thus current contribution of iodized household salt is unknown in the U.S.
&nbsp;Ground water is an important source of iodine in some regions of the
world, but it is unclear how water may contribute to iodine intake in the U.S.</p>
<p>Salt samples were collected
during the household interview. Only salts identified as iodized using the
container label (including nutrition facts panel and the ingredient list), or those
with iodization status not able be ascertained by the package were collected
for analysis. If the household had more
than one salt product that contained iodine, samples were collected from the
two most used salts from that household.&nbsp;Please refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-Interviewer-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Interviewer Procedures Manual 2020
(cdc.gov)</a> for additional information on the salt sample collection.&nbsp; </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All participants aged 3 years and older in the NHANES 2019-March 2020 convenience sample were eligible.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method directly measures the iodine content of salt
samples using inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after a simple
dilution sample preparation step. The samples are prepared by weighing out
0.625 g of each sample and diluting with 250 mL of &ge;18 Mohm∙cm water. The
salt/water solution is mixed using a shaker until all salt is completely
dissolved. This mixing step is vital to provide a homogeneous sample from which
to sub-sample. &nbsp;Salt samples are diluted
with 49 parts diluent and introduced into the mass spectrometer for
measurement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Refer to the Laboratory Method Files
section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used.</p>
<p>This is a new component in the 2019-2020
survey cycle. </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

        </p>
        <h2 id="Laboratory_Quality_Assurance_and_Monitoring">Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring</h2><p>Salt specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the
Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and
processing are discussed in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials were stored under appropriate room
temperature conditions (17-25<sup>o</sup>C) until they were shipped to National
Center for Environmental Health for testing.</p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)
protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates.
Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">NHANES LPM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)</strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Laboratories</strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected during &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.</p>
<p>NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.
1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were
followed. Reported results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory
Sciences&rsquo; QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the
Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or
improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field
operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey
locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the
remaining 12 locations. Calculation of survey weights for this partial cycle is
not possible due to incomplete data collection. Therefore, data from survey
components that were only collected in 2019-March 2020 are made available as
convenience samples through <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/">NCHS's
Research Data Center (RDC)</a> because unbiased estimates for the NHANES target population cannot be
produced with these samples. </p>
<p>For survey components conducted in both 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 cycles,
data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from 2017 to
2018 to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data. Please see the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data</a> page for detailed information on this combined sample.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019 &ndash; 2020 Laboratory Data Overview</a> for general information on
NHANES laboratory data. </p>
<p>There are over 800
laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all
participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be
performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary. </p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data may require
additional demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/limited_access/DEMO_K_R.htm">NHANES 2019-March 2020 Demographics</a> File contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews. This laboratory data file can be linked to the Demographics
file and other NHANES data files in the 2019-March 2020 convenience sample using the unique survey participant
identifier (i.e., SEQN).</p>
<p>Information on participants&rsquo; household salt use and information on the container labels from which the salt samples were collected is available in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/limited_access/SUQ_K_R.htm">Salt Use (SUQ_K_R) </a>file. The dataset contains one record for each salt container reported in the household. Therefore, for participants in a household with more than one salt product used, they could have up to two records under their survey participant identifier, SEQN. For these participants, the record with INSTANCE = 1 contains information from the first reported salt, and the record with INSTANCE = 2 contains information from the second salt. The salt use questionnaire dataset can be merged to the laboratory iodine - salt dataset using SEQN. Laboratory results reported in LBXSL1 (first salt collection) and LBXSL2 (second salt collection) are corresponding to the information in the records with INSTANCE = 1 and INSTANCE = 2 for the same participant in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/limited_access/SUQ_K_R.htm">SUQ_K_R</a> file, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits</strong></p>
<p>The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes
in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The
variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDSL1LC) indicates whether the result was
below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the result was at or
above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection.&nbsp; The other variable prefixed
LBX (ex., LBXSL1<em>) </em>provides the
analytic result for that analyte.&nbsp; For analytes with
analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDSL1LC=1), an imputed fill
value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The lower limit of
detection (LLOD in mg/kg)&nbsp;for Iodine - Salt:&nbsp;</p>
