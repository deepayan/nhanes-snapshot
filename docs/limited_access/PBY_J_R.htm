        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown
to affect deleteriously the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and
reproductive systems. In young children, lead exposure is a particular hazard
because children more readily absorb lead than adults, and children&rsquo;s
developing nervous systems also make them more susceptible to the effects of
lead. The primary sources of exposure for children are lead-laden paint chips
and dust as a result of deteriorating lead-based paint. The risk for lead exposure
is disproportionately higher for children who are poor, non-Hispanic black,
living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older housing. Among adults,
the most common high exposure sources are occupational. Blood lead levels
measured in previous NHANES cycles have been the cornerstone of lead exposure
surveillance in the U.S. The data have been used to document the burden and
dramatic decline of elevated blood lead levels, to promote the reduction of
lead use, and to help to redefine national lead poisoning prevention
guidelines, standards, and abatement activities. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 1 year and older were
eligible. This file only includes data from examined participants aged 1 to 5
years with limited access.&nbsp; See Analytic
Notes for information on data from participants aged 6 years and older.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method directly measures lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd),
total mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), and selenium (Se) content of whole blood
specimens using mass spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation
step.</p>
<p>During the sample dilution step, a small volume of whole
blood is extracted from a larger whole blood patient specimen after the entire
specimen is mixed (vortexed) to create a uniform distribution of cellular
components. This mixing step is important because some metals (e.g., Pb) are
known to be associated mostly with the red blood cells in the specimen and a
uniform distribution of this cellular material must be produced before a small
volume extracted from the larger specimen will accurately reflect the average
metal concentration of all fractions of the larger specimen. Coagulation is the
process in which blood forms solid clots from its cellular components. If steps
are not taken to prevent this process from occurring, i.e., addition of
anti-coagulant reagents such as EDTA in the blood collection tube prior to
blood collection, blood will immediately begin to form clots once leaving the
body and entering the tube. These clots prevent the uniform distribution of
cellular material in the blood specimen even after rigorous mixing, making a
representative sub-sample of the larger specimen unattainable. It is important
that prior to or during sample preparation the analyst identify any sample
having clots or micro-clots (small clots). Clotted samples are not analyzed by
this method due to the inhomogeneity concerns (i.e., all results for the sample
are processed as &ldquo;not reportable&rdquo;). </p>
<p>Dilution of the blood in the sample preparation step
prior to analysis is a simple dilution of 1 part sample + 1 part water + 48
parts diluent. The effects of the chemicals in the diluent are to release
metals bound to red blood cells making them available for ionization, reduce
ionization suppression by the biological matrix, prevent clogging of the sample
introduction system pathways by undissolved biological solids, and allow
introduction of internal standards to be utilized in the analysis step.
Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH, 0.4% v/v) and Triton X-100TM (0.05%) in
the sample diluent solubilizes blood components. Triton X-100TM also helps
prevent biological deposits on internal surfaces of the instrument&rsquo;s sample introduction
system and reduce collection of air bubbles in sample transport tubing.
Ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) in the sample diluent (0.01%) aids
in solubilizing metals released from the biological matrix. Ethyl alcohol in
the sample diluent (1%) aids solubility of blood components and aids in aerosol
generation by reduction of the surface tension of the solution. The internal
standards, rhodium, iridium, and tellurium, are at a constant concentration in
all blanks, calibrators, QC, and samples. Monitoring the instrument signal
ratio of a metal to its internal standard allows correction for instrument
noise and drift, and sample-to-sample matrix differences. </p>
<p>Liquid samples are introduced into the mass spectrometer
through the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ionization source. The liquid
diluted blood sample is forced through a nebulizer, which converts the bulk
liquid into small droplets in an argon aerosol. The smaller droplets from the
aerosol are selectively passed through the spray chamber by a flowing argon
stream into the ICP. By coupling radio-frequency power into flowing argon,
plasma is created in which the predominant species are positive argon ions and
electrons and has a temperature of 6000-8000 K. The small aerosol droplets pass
through a region of the plasma and the thermal energy vaporizes the liquid
droplets, atomizes the molecules of the sample and then ionizes the atoms. The
ions, along with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer through an interface
that separates the ICP (at atmospheric pressure, ~760 torr) from the mass
spectrometer (operating at a pressure of 10-5 torr). The ions first pass
through a focusing region, then the dynamic reaction cell (DRC), the quadrupole
mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in rapid sequence at the
detector allowing individual isotopes of an element to be determined. </p>
<p>Generally, the DRC operates in one of two modes. In
&lsquo;vented&rsquo; (or &lsquo;standard&rsquo;) mode the cell is not pressurized and ions pass through
the cell to the quadrupole mass filter unaffected. In &lsquo;DRC&rsquo; mode, the cell is
pressurized with a gas for the purpose of causing collisions and/or reactions
between the fill gas and the incoming ions. In general, collisions or reactions
with the incoming ions selectively occur to either eliminate an interfering
ion, change the ion of interest to a new mass, which is free from interference,
or collisions between ions in the beam and the DRC gas can focus the ion beam
to the middle of the cell and increase the ion signal. In this method, the
instrument is operated in DRC mode when analyzing for manganese, mercury, and
selenium. For selenium, the DRC is pressurized with methane gas (CH4, 99.999%)
which reduces the signal from 40Ar2+ while allowing the 80Se+ ions to pass
relatively unaffected through the DRC on toward the analytical quadrupole and
detector. Manganese and mercury are both measured when the DRC is pressurized
with oxygen gas (O2, 99.999%). They are analyzed at the same flow rate of
oxygen to the DRC cell to avoid lengthening analysis time due to pause delays
that would be necessary if different gas flows were used for the two analytes.
The oxygen reduces the ion signal from several interfering ions (37Cl18O+,
40Ar15N+, 38Ar16O1H+, 54Fe1H+) while allowing the Mn+ ion stream to pass relatively
unaffected through the DRC on toward the analytical quadrupole and detector. In
the case of mercury, collisional focusing of the mercury ions occurs,
increasing the observed mercury signal at the detector by approximately a
factor of two (2x). </p>
<p>Once ions pass through the DRC cell and electrically
selected for passage through the analytical quadrupole, electrical signals
resulting from the ions striking the discrete dynode detector are processed
into digital information that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions.
The intensity of ions detected while aspirating an unknown sample is correlated
to an elemental concentration through comparison of the analyte: internal
standard signal ratio with that obtained when aspirating calibration standards.
This method was originally based on the method by Lutz (Lutz et al., 1991). The
DRC portions of the method are based on work published by Tanner (Tanner, et
al. 1999; 2002). </p>

to the National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and
processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM)</a>. Vials are stored under
appropriate frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center
for Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)
protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed
QA/QC instructions are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">NHANES LPM</a>. </p>
<p><b>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) </b></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff
member is observed for equipment operation, specimen collection and
preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are given to each
staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that
required skill levels were maintained. <br />
<br />
<b>Analytical Laboratories </b></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens. <br />
<br />
NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern. <br />
<br />
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental
Health&nbsp;Laboratory Sciences quality control and quality assurance
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable
values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation. </p>
<p>One&nbsp;additional variable was created for this data
file. The variable was created using the following formulas:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><b>LBDBPBSI:</b>&nbsp; The analyte lead value in &micro;g/dL
(LBXBPB) was converted to &micro;mol/L (LBDBPBSI) by multiplying LBXBPB by 0.0483 (Round
2 decimal points).</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017" target="_blank">2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview </a>for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.</p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx" target="_blank">Analytic
Guidelines</a> and the on-line <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">NHANES </a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues.</p>
<p><b>Demographic and Other Related Variables </b></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;CycleBeginYear=2017" target="_blank">NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics File</a>
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm" target="_blank">Fasting
Questionnaire File </a>includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other
NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><b>Detection Limits </b></p>
<p>The detection limits were constant for all of the
analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these
analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDBCDLC) indicates whether
the result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the
result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result
was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., LBXBCD)
provides the analytic result for the analyte. For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex. LBDBCDLC=1), an imputed fill
value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). <br />
