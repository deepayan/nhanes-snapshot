        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program
suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020
cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from
2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to
form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic
Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown
to affect deleteriously the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and
reproductive systems. In young children, lead exposure is a particular hazard
because children more readily absorb lead than adults, and children&rsquo;s
developing nervous systems also make them more susceptible to the effects of
lead. The primary sources of exposure for children are lead-laden paint chips
and dust as a result of deteriorating lead-based paint. The risk for lead exposure
is disproportionately higher for children who are poor, non-Hispanic black,
living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older housing. Among adults,
the most common high exposure sources are occupational. Blood lead levels
measured in previous NHANES cycles have been the cornerstone of lead exposure
surveillance in the U.S. The data have been used to document the burden and
dramatic decline of elevated blood lead levels, to promote the reduction of
lead use, and to help to redefine national lead poisoning prevention
guidelines, standards, and abatement activities. </p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>Examined participants aged 1 year and older in the
NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible.
This file only includes data from examined participants aged 1 to 5 years with
limited access.&nbsp; See Analytic Notes for information
on data from participants aged 6 years and older.</p><h2 id="Description_of_Laboratory_Methodology">Description of Laboratory Methodology</h2><p>This method directly measures lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd),
total mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), and selenium (Se) content of whole blood
specimens using mass spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation
step.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the sample
dilution step, a small volume of whole blood is extracted from a larger whole
blood patient specimen after the entire specimen is mixed (vortexed) to create
a uniform distribution of cellular components. This mixing step is important because
some metals (e.g., Pb) are known to be associated mostly with the red blood
cells in the specimen and a uniform distribution of this cellular material must
be produced before a small volume extracted from the larger specimen will
accurately reflect the average metal concentration of all fractions of the
larger specimen. Coagulation is the process in which blood forms solid clots
from its cellular components. If steps are not taken to prevent this process
from occurring, i.e., addition of anti-coagulant reagents such as EDTA in the
blood collection tube prior to blood collection, blood will immediately begin
to form clots once leaving the body and entering the tube. These clots prevent
the uniform distribution of cellular material in the blood specimen even after
rigorous mixing, making a representative sub-sample of the larger specimen
unattainable. It is important that prior to or during sample preparation the
analyst identify any sample having clots or micro-clots (small clots). Clotted
samples are not analyzed by this method due to the inhomogeneity concerns
(i.e., all results for the sample are processed as &ldquo;not reportable&rdquo;). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Liquid samples
are introduced into the mass spectrometer through the inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) ionization source. The liquid diluted blood sample is forced
through a nebulizer with argon gas, which converts the bulk liquid into an
aerosol of small droplets. The smaller droplets in the aerosol are selectively
passed through the spray chamber by a flowing argon stream into the 6000-8000K
plasma of the ICP. The high energy of the plasma results
in the ionization of the atoms of lead, cadmium, mercury, manganese, and
selenium from the droplets from the sample. The ions enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the atmospheric pressure, ~760
torr, of the ICP from the vacuum region, ~10<sup>-5</sup> torr, within the mass
spectrometer. After
the interface, the ions pass through a focusing region, then the first
quadrupole mass filter (Q1), the collision-reaction cell (or octopole reaction
system, ORS), a second quadrupole mass filter (Q2), and finally are selectively
counted in rapid sequence of mass-to-charge ratios at the detector.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Electrical signals associated with each mass-to-charge
ratio monitored are summed by a computer, and the magnitude of the signals
detected while aspirating an unknown sample is correlated to an elemental
concentration through comparison of the blank-subtracted analyte / internal
standard signal ratio of the unknown sample with the signal ratio obtained when
aspirating calibrators. This method was originally based on the method by Jones
(Jones, et al., 2017).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a
detailed description of the laboratory methods used. There
was a change to the method between the 2017-2018 and the 2019-March 2020
cycles. </p><h2 id="Laboratory_Method_Files">Laboratory Method Files</h2>

<p>Detailed instructions on specimen collection and
processing are discussed in the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf">2019-2020</a>
NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPMs). Vials are stored under appropriate
frozen (&ndash;30&deg;C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center for
Environmental Health for testing. </p>
<p>The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)
protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed
QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPMs. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) </strong></p>
<p>Laboratory team performance is monitored using several
techniques. NCHS and contract consultants use a structured competency
assessment evaluation during visits to evaluate both the quality of the
laboratory work and the QC procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed
for equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing
procedures and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels
were maintained. <br />
<br />
<strong>Analytical Laboratories </strong></p>
<p>NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the
analyses performed by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods
include performing blind split samples collected on &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens. <br />
<br />
NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract laboratories,
which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981) when testing
NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the
data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.
<br />
<br />
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental
Health&nbsp;Laboratory Sciences QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and
precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable
values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation. </p>
<p>One additional variable was created for this data file.
The variables were created using the following formulas:</p>
<p><strong>LBDBPBSI:</strong>&nbsp; The analyte lead value in &micro;g/dL
(LBXBPB) was converted to &micro;mol/L (LBDBPBSI) by multiplying LBXBPB by 0.0483 (Round
3 decimal points).</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field
operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey
locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the
remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not
nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the previous
cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017">2017-2018</a> and <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019">2019-2020</a>
Laboratory Data Overview documents for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.</p>
<p>There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants.
However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all
the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or
other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020,
approximately 76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC
provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age
18 and older provided a blood specimen. &nbsp;Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for
item non-response is necessary. </p>
<p>Please refer to the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx">Analytic Guidelines</a> and the on-line NHANES <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/">Tutorial</a> for further details
on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and Other Related Variables </strong></p>
<p>The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&amp;Cycle=2017-2020">NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Demographics
File</a> contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm">Fasting
Questionnaire File</a> includes auxiliary information, such as fasting
status, length of fast, and the time of venipuncture. </p>
<p>This laboratory data file can be linked to the other
NHANES data files using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). </p>
<p><strong>Detection Limits </strong></p>
<p>The change in methods between the 2017-2018 and
2019-March 2020 cycles resulted in lower limits of detection for the 2019-March
2020 survey cycle.&nbsp; In order to make the
merged dataset compatible the detection limits were made constant for all of
the analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these
analytes. The variable name ending in &ldquo;LC&rdquo; (ex., LBDBCDLC) indicates whether
the result was below the limit of detection: the value &ldquo;0&rdquo; means that the
result was at or above the limit of detection, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates that the result
was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., LBXBCD)
provides the analytic result for the analyte. For analytes with analytic
results below the lower limit of detection (ex. LBDBCDLC=1), an imputed fill
value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). <br />
