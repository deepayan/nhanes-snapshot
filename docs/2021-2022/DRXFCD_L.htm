        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages (including all types of water) consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview (midnight to midnight), and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the person&rsquo;s overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual, and whether the participant is on any type of special diet. Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days are asked of participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young children (see the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank">Dietary Interview Procedure Manuals (cdc.gov)</a> for more information on the proxy interview).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dietary interview component, called What We Eat in America (WWEIA), is conducted as a partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Under this partnership, DHHS' National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys is responsible for the survey sample design and all aspects of data collection and USDA&rsquo;s Food Surveys Research Group (FSRG) is responsible for the dietary data collection methodology, maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data, and data review and processing.</p>
<p>All NHANES participants are eligible for two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Traditionally, the first dietary recall interview was collected in-person in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) and the second interview was collected by telephone 3 to 10 days later. In August 2021-August 2023, the time participants spent in the MEC was limited to reduce risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. As a result, both dietary recall interviews were administered via telephone. Further information about changes in data collection are described in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_01/sr01-066.pdf" target="_blank">Plan and Operations report of the NHANES August 2021-August 2023</a>.</p>
<p>As in previous years, two types of dietary intake data are available for the August 2021-August 2023 survey cycle: Individual Foods files and Total Nutrient Intakes files.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What's New with the August 2021-August 2023 WWEIA Release:&nbsp;</strong><br />
</p>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mode of the first dietary recall changed from in-person during the MEC examination to telephone 3 to 7 days after the examination. Both dietary interviews were completed in English or Spanish. During the mobile examination, participants scheduled an appointment for the first telephone dietary interview and received a set of measuring guides to help estimate the amounts of foods and beverages consumed. <a href="#Appendix_1" target="_blank"><strong>Appendix 1</strong></a>&nbsp;provides a summary of changes among the 5 latest cycles of data collection. No new data variables were added in the August 2021-August 2023 WWEIA release.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Interview Data Files: </strong>Four data files were produced from the information collected in the dietary interviews: two Individual Foods files and two Total Nutrient Intakes files. Each file includes one day of intake data. The number &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;2&rdquo; in the file name identifies the day of the interview: 1 = first day, 2 = second day. File names are as follows:</p>

<p>The amounts in these files reflect only nutrients obtained from foods, beverages, and water, including tap and bottled water. They do not include nutrients obtained from dietary supplement intakes, antacids, or medications. Data on intake of dietary supplement use are available on the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&amp;Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank">August 2021-August 2023 Dietary Data (cdc.gov) page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Foods Files (DR1IFF_L and DR2IFF_L):</strong> Detailed information about each food/beverage item (including the description, amount of, and nutrient content) reported by each participant is included in the Individual Foods files. The names for both Day 1 and Day 2 variables are listed in <strong><a href="#Appendix_2" target="_blank">Appendix 2</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Individual Foods files include, for each interview day, one record for each food/beverage consumed by a participant. Each record is uniquely numbered within a participant&rsquo;s set of records and contains the information listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of days of complete intake obtained from participant;</li>
    <li>Day of the week of the intake; </li>
    <li>Whether the food/beverage was eaten in combination with other foods, such as in a sandwich; </li>
    <li>Time of eating occasion/when the food was eaten; </li>
    <li>Eating occasion name; </li>
    <li>Where the food/beverage was obtained; </li>
    <li>Whether the&nbsp;meal/snack was eaten at home or not; </li>
    <li>A USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) code identifying the food/beverage; </li>
    <li>Amount of food/beverage consumed, in grams; and&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Food energy and 64 nutrients/food components (listed in <strong><a href="#Appendix_3" target="_blank">Appendix 3</a></strong>) from each food/beverage as calculated using USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2021-2023 (FNDDS 2021-2023).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Descriptions for the USDA FNDDS food codes are provided in the Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_L). The DRXFCD_L file includes abbreviated descriptions (up to 60 characters) and complete descriptions (up to 200 characters) associated with each USDA food code in the FNDDS 2021-2023.&nbsp;<strong><a href="#Appendix_4" target="_blank">Appendix 4</a></strong>&nbsp;provides SAS code examples that may be used to link the food code description to the Individual Foods file.</p>
<p><strong>Total Nutrient Intakes Files (DR1TOT_L and DR2TOT_L):</strong> For each participant, daily total energy and nutrient intakes from foods and beverages, and whether the amount of food consumed was usual, much more than usual, or much less than usual, are included in the Total Nutrient Intakes files. The Day 1 file also includes information on salt use in cooking and at the table; whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for another health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet; and information on frequency of fish and shellfish consumption for participants aged 1 or older. The names for both Day 1 and Day 2 variables are listed in <strong><a href="#Appendix_5" target="_blank">Appendix 5</a></strong>.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><strong> </strong> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Total Nutrient Intakes files provide a summary record of total nutrient intakes for each participant. Each total intake record contains the following information: </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of days of complete intake obtained from participant; </li>
    <li>Day of the week of the intake; </li>
    <li>Type of salt used and how often added at the table and in food preparation (Day 1 file only);</li>
    <li>Use of salt at the table yesterday and the type of salt used;</li>
    <li>Whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet (Day 1 file only); </li>
    <li>Total number of foods and beverages including water reported for that participant for that day's intake; </li>
    <li>Daily aggregates of food energy and 64 nutrients/food components (listed in <strong><a href="#Appendix_3" target="_blank">Appendix 3</a></strong>) from all foods/beverages as calculated using USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies August 2021-August 2023 (FNDDS 2021- 2023)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Whether the amount of food consumed was usual, much more than usual, or much less than usual;</li>
    <li>Total amount of tap and bottled water consumed (calculated as the sum of reports of water drunk by itself in the 24-hour recall) and the usual source of tap water; and</li>
    <li>Frequency of fish and shellfish consumption in the past 30 days (participants 1 year or older, Day 1 file only).</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All participants in the August 2021-August 2023 sample who spoke English or Spanish were eligible. Participants aged 1 year or older were eligible for the frequency of fish and shellfish consumption questions following the 24-hour recall.</p><h2 id="Protocol_and_Procedure">Protocol and Procedure</h2><p>The examination protocol and data collection methods are fully documented in the NHANES <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank">dietary interviewer procedures manuals</a>.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted with a proxy for participants less than six years of age (who was generally the person most knowledgeable about the participant&rsquo;s intake). Interviews of children aged 6 to 8 were conducted with a proxy and the child was present to assist in reporting intake information. Interviews of children aged 9-11, were conducted with the child and the assistance of a proxy familiar with the child&rsquo;s intake. Participants 12 years or older answered for themselves. Dietary interviewers conducted telephone interviews in English and Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the MEC visit, participants were scheduled an appointment for the first dietary interview and were given a set of measuring guides (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/measuring_guides_dri/measuringguides.htm" target="_blank">NHANES Measuring Guides for the Dietary Recall Interview</a>) to use for reporting food amounts during the telephone interview. The measuring guides included measuring cups, spoons, a ruler, and a food model booklet, which contained two-dimensional drawings of glasses, mugs, bowls, mounds, circles, wedges, a shape chart and a chicken chart. The first telephone dietary interview was scheduled 3 to 7 days post MEC examination while the second interview was collected 3 to 10 days following the first dietary interview and were generally scheduled on a different day of the week as the first interview. In August 2021-August 2023, 204 participants were interviewed on the same day of the week for both day 1 and day 2 interviews due to their scheduling availability. Any participant who did not have a telephone was given a toll-free number to call so that the recall could be conducted.<br />
</p>
<p>What We Eat in America data were collected using USDA's dietary data collection instrument, the Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM), available at: <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg" target="_blank">http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg</a>. The AMPM was designed to provide an efficient and accurate means of collecting intakes for large-scale national surveys. The AMPM is a fully computerized recall method that uses a 5-step interview outlined below:<br />
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Quick List</strong> - Participant recalls all foods and beverages consumed the day before the interview (midnight to midnight). </li>
    <li><strong>Forgotten Foods</strong> - Participant is asked about consumption of foods commonly forgotten during the Quick List step. </li>
    <li><strong>Time and Occasion</strong> - Time and eating occasion are collected for each food. </li>
    <li><strong>Detail Cycle</strong> - For each food, a detailed description, amount eaten, and additions to the food are collected. Eating occasions and times between eating occasions are reviewed to elicit forgotten foods. </li>
    <li><strong>Final Probe</strong> - Additional foods not remembered earlier are collected. </li>
</ol>
<p>The AMPM includes an extensive compilation of standardized food-specific questions and possible response options. Routing of questions is based on previous responses. The AMPM is updated for each 2-year collection of WWEIA to reflect the changing food supply and to address research needs from the data user community. Additional information about the AMPM is provided in Raper et al. (<a href="#Cen_RP" target="_blank">Raper et al., 2004</a>).</p>
<p>The AMPM was validated in a large study and shown to be an effective method for collecting accurate group energy intake of adults. Completed in 2004, this extensive research project included 524 healthy, weight-stable volunteers, aged 30-69 years. The accuracy of the AMPM was evaluated by comparing reported energy intake (EI) to total energy expenditure (TEE) using the doubly labeled water technique (<a href="#Cen_MR" target="_blank">Moshfegh et al., 2008</a>). Among the findings were that EI compared to TEE was under-reported by 11% overall, by less than 3% for normal weight subjects with body mass index (BMI)&nbsp;&lt; 25 and 16% for overweight subjects with BMI&nbsp;&ge; 25.</p>
<p>Additional studies provide evidence that the AMPM accurately measures group energy intake. Blanton (<a href="#Cen_Blanton" target="_blank">Blanton et al., 2006</a>) reported that EI was not significantly different from TEE for a sample of 20 adult females. Rumpler (<a href="#Cen_Rumpler" target="_blank">Rumpler et al., 2008</a>)&nbsp;found that mean EIs were accurately reported for a sample of 12 adult males.</p>
<p>Additional evidence for the accuracy of AMPM has been provided by analysis of the 24-hour urinary sodium data collected in the AMPM Validation Study, which suggest the AMPM is a valid measure for estimating mean sodium intake in adults. Dietary sodium intake calculated from 24-hour recall data of 465 subjects collected via AMPM was compared with sodium values from 24-hour urine collections measured during the same 24-hour period. The AMPM-derived mean dietary sodium estimates reflected over 90% of the biomarker-based estimates&nbsp;(<a href="#Cen_Rhodes" target="_blank">Rhodes et al., 2013</a>).</p>

Retraining sessions were conducted annually to reinforce the proper protocols and technique.</p>
<p>Interviewers were monitored throughout the data collection period. Monitoring consisted of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reviews of audio recorded interviews were conducted for approximately 5% of each interviewer's work. </li>
    <li>Quality control of interviews, which were checked for completeness of the recalls, missing information, inconsistent reports, and unclear notes. Written notification and feedback were provided to the interviewers.
    </li>
</ul><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Interview data files were sent electronically from the field and were imported into Survey Net, a computer-assisted food coding and data management system developed by USDA (<a href="#Cen_RP" target="_blank">Raper et al., 2004</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/" target="_blank">USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS)</a> 2021-2023 was used to process the intakes reported by the August 2021-August 2023 sample. The FNDDS includes comprehensive information that can be used to code individual foods/beverages and portion sizes reported by participants and includes nutrient values for calculating nutrient intakes. FNDDS nutrient values as well as food codes and portion sizes are updated for every 2-year WWEIA, NHANES release cycle. The basis for the nutrient values as well as food codes and portion weights in FNDDS are detailed in the documentation for FNDDS 2021-2023 available at <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/" target="_blank">http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coders were required to pass a certification test after the initial training. They were routinely monitored to ensure the quality and completeness of their work. Approximately 10 percent of the coder's work was randomly selected to be independently coded by another coder. Results from the two codings were compared and adjudicated, if necessary.<br />
</p>
<p>After intake data were coded, various types of reviews and quality assurance procedures were conducted to ensure the quality of the data. Examples of reviews include the following:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Interviewers' and coders' questions and comments were reviewed to ensure that they have been addressed. </li>
    <li>Decisions made by coders about how to code new or unusual foods/beverages or quantities reported by participants were reviewed for accuracy, reasonableness, and consistency across intake data; items in question were resolved by coder supervisors.</li>
    <li>Specific data integrity checks for reasonableness, consistency, and logic were conducted. </li>
</ul><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>Each Individual Foods file (Day 1 and Day 2) is comprised of food records. For most participants, there are multiple records in each file. For each Total Nutrient Intakes file (Day 1 and Day 2) there is one record for each participant. These files can be linked with other NHANES files by the respondent sequence number (SEQN).</p>
<p><strong>Variable names:</strong> For data collected on both Day 1 and Day 2, variable names are differentiated by having the number "1" or "2" in the third position of the variable name to identify the collection day. For example, the USDA food code variable (in the Individual Foods File), which identifies the food reported by the participant, is named DR1IFDCD in the Day 1 file and DR2IFDCD in the Day 2 file.<strong> </strong>Appendices<strong> </strong><strong><a href="#Appendix_2" target="_blank">2</a></strong> and&nbsp;<strong><a href="#Appendix_5" target="_blank">5</a></strong> list the Day 1 and Day 2 variable names for the Individual Foods file and the Total Nutrient Intakes file, respectively.</p>
<p>Names for the following variables are the same for both days in the Individual Foods file and the Total Nutrient Intakes file:<br />

</table>
<p><strong>Number of days of intake:</strong>&nbsp;A variable has been included to indicate the number of days of intake collected from each participant. The variable name is DRDINT. In the August 2021-August 2023 sample, 6,754 participants provided complete dietary intakes for Day 1. The 6,754 participants with a complete Day 1 intake include 21 participants who had an unreliable day 1 intake but reliable day 2 intake. For these 21 individuals, the single reliable recall is included in the data set as Day 1 recall. Of those providing the Day 1 data, 5,879 provided complete dietary intakes for Day 2.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary recall status code:</strong> A status code (DR1DRSTZ or DR2DRSTZ) is used in both the Individual Foods and Total Nutrient Intakes files to indicate the quality and completeness of a survey participant's response to the dietary recall section. The codes are the following:</p>
<p>1 = Reliable and met the following minimum criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first 4 steps of the 5-step AMPM completed.</li>
    <li>Food/beverages consumed for each reported eating occasion identified.</li>
</ul>
<p>For individuals with a code 1, all relevant variables associated with the 24-hour dietary recall contain a value. </p>
<p>2 = Not reliable or did not meet the minimum criteria</p>
<p>Individuals with a code 2 have incomplete records. No data on total nutrient intakes and the total number of foods reported are provided for these cases. These individuals have no records in the Individual Foods files.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Code 3 is not included in the current datasets. It was only used for data from the 1999-2000 survey cycle.]</p>
<p>4 = Reported consuming breast milk </p>
<p>For infants and children who consumed human milk, there is a record in the Individual Foods files for each report of human milk. However, because amounts of human milk intake are not quantified, these records contain missing values for the amount consumed and for the amounts of energy and nutrients from human milk. Also, records of human milk have a missing value for the food source variable (DR1FS, DR2FS) and the eaten at home variable (DR1_040Z, DR2_040Z) in the Individual Foods files. Records for any other foods and beverages consumed by breast-fed infants and children are included in the Individual Foods files along with their amounts and nutrient information. Because of the missing amount or quantity information for human milk, no total nutrient intakes (contained in the Total Nutrient Intakes files) were computed for participants with a code 4.</p>
<p>A variable that identifies breast-fed children, DRABF, is included. This variable has a code of 1 if a child consumed human milk in either intake day. </p>
<p>5 = Not done</p>
<p>This code is assigned when the dietary recall section of the interview did not take place due to various reasons (such as refusal, equipment failure, or unable to contact the participant). These individuals have no records in the Individual Foods files. These individuals have a record in the Total Nutrients file with values only for the following variables: the respondent sequence number (SEQN), the dietary recall status code (DR1DRSTZ or DR2DRSTZ) and for participants 1 year or older, the fish and shellfish questions in the DR1TOT_L file (DRD340, DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ, DRD360, DRD370A-V, and DRD370AQ-UQ).</p>
<p>Only codes 1 and 4 appear in the Individual Foods file.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Between Foods/Beverages and Dietary Supplements in NHANES:&nbsp;</strong>In August 2021-August 2023, there was no 24-hour dietary supplement use collection.&nbsp; The 30-day dietary supplement use collection changed from being collected during the home interview to collection after the first 24-hour dietary recall via telephone. All NHANES participants responding to the 24-hour dietary recall interview are eligible for the dietary supplement and non-prescription antacid use questions. Information is obtained on all vitamins, minerals, herbals, and other dietary supplements as well as non-prescription antacids that were consumed during a 30-day period, including the name and the amount of supplement or antacid taken.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between foods/beverages and supplements can be challenging. NCHS and FSRG review questionable items reported in the dietary supplement and dietary recall components to resolve disposition of these items into the appropriate component. Products that are labeled as a dietary supplement, that have a supplement facts panel on the label, and are in tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, or other pill forms, are considered dietary supplements. Items that are powders or liquids can be hard to distinguish. General guidelines used state that if powders and liquid concentrates have product directions stating that they be added to a liquid, they are classified as beverages. Examples are teas and protein powders. An exception is made for fiber products, which are classified as dietary supplements. Along this same guideline, energy drinks are considered beverages, but &ldquo;energy shot&rdquo; type products are considered dietary supplements.<br />
</p>
<p>It is best to refer to the databases that detail every food/beverage and dietary supplement reported in NHANES to identify exact determination used. The databases are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group" target="_blank">2021-2023 Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&amp;Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank">NHANES Dietary Supplement Database </a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Participants who reported consuming only water, no food or other beverages: </strong>Records are included in the Individual Foods file for participants who consumed only water. There are 5 such individuals in the August 2021-August 2023 datasets, 4 in the Day 1 data and 1 in the Day 2 data. Their dietary recall status variable for the day is coded as "1" (complete and reliable) in the Total Nutrients file and the total number of items is the number of times water was reported. Individuals with just water intake and no food intake will have zero energy intake for the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Participants who reported consuming no water, food or other beverages: </strong>There can be participants whose intakes are determined to be complete even though they reported no water, food, or other beverage records for the day. For such participants there are no records in the Individual Foods file, but their dietary recall status is coded as complete and reliable, and the Total Nutrients file will include records with zero values for all nutrients. In the August 2021-August 2023 datasets, there are 3 individuals in the day 1 data that reported no water, food, or other beverage records for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Number of days between the intake day and the day of family interview:</strong>&nbsp;Each of the four intake files includes a variable (DR1DBIH for Day 1 files and DR2DBIH for Day 2 files) to indicate the number of days between the intake day (i.e., the period covered by the 24-hour recall) and the day that the family questionnaire was administered in the household. A positive value in DR1BHIH or DR2BHIH indicates the family interview occurred prior to the intake day. In the survey, most of the family interviews were done before the participant participated in the dietary interview. A value of "0" in DR1BHIH or DR2BHIH indicates the family interview occurred on the same date as the intake day. A negative value (i.e., DR1BHIH&lt;0 or DR2BHIH&lt;0) means that the family interview occurred after the intake day.</p>
<p><strong>Food source:</strong> The source from which each food/beverage was obtained (e.g., from a store, fast food restaurant, cafeteria) is identified by the variables DR1FS (day 1) and DR2FS (day 2) in the Individual Foods files.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>The What We Eat in America Food Categories, </strong>available on the FSRG website&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg" target="_blank">http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg</a>), is a grouping scheme that combines foods and beverages together that have similar usage and nutrient content with the emphasis on how they are commonly consumed in the American diet. There are more than 170 unique categories, and each is assigned a 4-digit number and description. The WWEIA Food Categories contain discrete food items and are not disaggregated (e.g., pizza vs. grain, cheese, tomatoes, etc.). Designed to be flexible, the categories can be combined as needed to address specific research questions. A new version of the WWEIA Food Categories is produced for each 2-year release cycle of WWEIA, NHANES. </p>
<p><strong>Special diet:</strong> Information on whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet, was provided. The variable DRQSDIET identifies whether a participant was on a special diet. The variables DRQSDT1 through DRQSDT12 and DRQSDT91 identify the type of diet or diets that the participant was following. These variables can be found in the Total Nutrient Intakes file.</p>
<p><strong>Sample weights for dietary intake data:</strong>&nbsp;The August 2021&ndash;August 2023 NHANES sample design is similar to past cycles that drew a multi-year, stratified, clustered four-stage sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population to provide national health estimates. To adapt to the continuing pandemic environment, this cycle also included an updated sample design to minimize contact between interviewers and survey participants. An <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewbrief.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank">overview of sample design, nonresponse bias assessment, and analytic guides for NHANES August 2021-August 2023</a> is provided on the NHANES website. In addition, a <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/dietarydatanotice.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank">Dietary Data Notice</a><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/dietarydatanotice.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023" target="_blank"> for Users</a> is also available online to provide additional information on the changes that pertain to the dietary data collection.</p>
<p>Similar to prior cycles, sample weights are constructed to encompass the unequal probabilities of selection, as well as adjustments for non-participation by selected sample persons. In order to produce national, representative estimates,<strong> the appropriate sample weights must be used.</strong></p>
<p>For the NHANES August 2021-August 2023 sample, there were 22,660 persons selected; of these 8,860 were considered participants to the MEC examination and data collection. A total of 6,754 MEC participants provided complete dietary intakes for Day 1, and of those providing the Day 1 data, 5,879 provided complete dietary intakes for Day 2. The 6,754 participants who provided complete Day 1 intakes includes 21 participants who had an unreliable day 1 intake and reliable day 2 intake. For these 21 individuals, the single reliable recall is included in the data set as Day 1 recall.</p>
<p>Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the WWEIA dietary data, different sample weights are recommended for analysis. Because food intake can vary by weekdays and weekends, use of the MEC weights disproportionately represents intakes on weekends.</p>
<p>A set of weights (WTDRD1) is provided that should be used when an analysis uses the Day 1 dietary recall data (either alone or when Day 1 nutrient data are used in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights (WTDRD1) is applicable to the 6,754 participants with Day 1 data. Day 1 weights were constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting for: (a) the additional non-response; and (b) the differential allocation by weekdays (Monday through Thursday) and weekends (Friday through Sunday) for the dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more variable than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated standard errors using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights might be larger than standard errors for similar estimates based on MEC weights.</p>
<p>When analysis is based on both days of dietary intake, only 5,879 sample participants have complete data. The NHANES protocol requires an attempt to collect the second day of dietary data at least 3 days after the first day, but the actual number of days between the two interviews is variable. A set of adjusted weights, WTDR2D, is to be used when an analysis uses the smaller sample with completed Day 1 and Day 2 dietary data. This two-day weight was constructed for the 5,879 participants by taking the Day 1 weights (WTDRD1) and further adjusting for: (a) the additional non-response for the second recall; and (b) for the proportion of weekend (Friday through Sunday) and weekday (Monday through Thursday) combinations of Day 1 and Day 2 recalls.</p>
<p>NOTE: All sample weights are person-level weights, and each set of dietary weights should sum to the same overall population control total as the MEC weights (WTMEC2YR). In addition, the MEC weights (WTMEC2YR) are appropriate for use in the analysis of the fish and shellfish consumption data (i.e., variables DRD340, DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ DRD360, DRD370A-V, and DRD370AQ-UQ) located in the Day 1 Total Nutrient Intake File (DR1TOT_L), if no other dietary data are included in the analysis.

          <h2 id="Appendix_4._Adding_Food_Code_Descriptions_to_Your_Files">Appendix 4. Adding Food Code Descriptions to Your Files</h2><a name="Appendix_4"></a>
<p>One supporting file is included with the Individual Foods files: the Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_L).</p>
<p>The DRXFCD_L file includes abbreviated descriptions (up to 60 characters) and complete descriptions (up to 200 characters) associated with each USDA food code included in the Individual Foods files. </p>
<p>The Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_L) contains three variables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DRXFDCD</strong> a numeric value corresponding to DR1IFDCD in the file DR1IFF_L or DR2IFDCD in the file DR2IFF_L;</p>
<p><strong>DRXFCSD</strong> a short description (up to 60 characters) of the food code; </p>
<p><strong>DRXFDLD</strong> a long description (up to 200 characters) of the food code. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following SQL code is an example of appending the shorter food code description (here renamed DR1IFCSD) to one of the Individual Foods files using PROC SQL from SAS&reg;. Other SQL implementations may be different. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
<strong>proc sql;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;create table DR1IFF_L_PLUS as&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;select iff.*, desc.DRXFCSD as DR1FCSD, desc.DRXFCLD as DR1FCLD&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;from NHANES.DR1IFF_L iff&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;left join NHANES.DRXFCD_L desc&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;on iff.DR1IFDCD = desc.DRXFDCD&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;order by SEQN, DR1ILINE;&nbsp;<br />
quit;</strong></p>
<p>SAS&reg; users may wish to use Proc Format to assign labels to the food codes. The following example generates and saves a picture format for food codes and a separate format for each food code that includes both the food code itself and the short food code description. It is assumed that the user has stored the Individual Foods files and the Food Code Description file in a library called NHANES and wishes to store the formats there as well.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>options fmtsearch = (NHANES);</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>proc format library = library;<br />

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>data tmp;<br />
